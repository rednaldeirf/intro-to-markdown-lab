## Bread Selection
The bread is really as important as you want it to be. Some people have dietary restrictions- work within your limits. The bread is important, but its not the main star of this sandwich.

## Peanut Butter

The age old question- smooth or crunchy? It's really a preference. I always go with smooth. Peanut butter is classic, but there are other nut butters that will be just as delicious for this classic sandwich.

>If you have a nut allergy, please do ***NOT*** attempt to eat this sandwich. Try *bologna...*

## Jelly
Again, just like the bread and peanut butter selection, jelly is a preference. Grape or strawberry are classic. But they have so many other flavors. Sweet seems like the obvious choice. But if you're feeling froggy, go for something savory- **why not?**

## Assembly
Once your ingredients have been selected, it's time to assemble your sandwich.
1. Put two slices of bread on a plate.
2. Using a butter knife, spread peanut butter on one slice of bread.
3. Using the same knife (or a different one), spread the jelly on the other slice of bread.
>This is the most crucial part- the ingredients must have their own slices of bread.
4. Marry the two slices of bread.
5. Cut in half- diagonally, horizonatally, or vertically. Or not at all. The choics is *yours!*
6. ***ENJOY!***
